Once you've completed the curriculum, you will receive an email from Credly with instructions on accepting your badge. If you can't find the Credly email, please check your spam or quarantine folder to avoid missing any important notifications regarding your achievement. We have received reports of NASA's email server sending these notifications to quarantine.

If you still have not received an email from Credly after 48 hours, please email [support@openscience101.org](mailto:support@openscience101.org).
