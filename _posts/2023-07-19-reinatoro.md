Dr. Reina Camacho Toro is an experimental particle physicist and a member of the ATLAS collaboration at CERN. Her research revolves aroundanalyzing data to better understand the smallest components of matter, researching and developing instrumentation, developing science capacity-building programs to foster the next generation of scientists in Latin America, and strengthening collaborations between Europe and Latin America. Reina is part of a European-Latin American network creating postgraduate courses in advanced physics guided by the principles of open science and education at LA-CoNGA physics. LA-CoNGA physics was launched in 2020 and co-funded by the Erasmus+ program with the support of CERN, ICTP-UNESCO, and CNRS, among other scientific and industrial partners. She is also participating in the TOPS effort to build the OpenCore curriculum.
