While the initial Open Science 101 course is in English, translation efforts are already underway for a Spanish version through our [TOPST funding solicitation](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?solId=%7bAB776446-03A8-4C24-845D-2E5A2ADA2D5A%7d&path=&method=init). Additionally, the modules are designed to be easily translatable. The animations and voice-overs were designed in a way where it will be easy to add other languages in the future.
