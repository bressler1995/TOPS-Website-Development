# **Feedback Invite**

# 

Dear XX,

We are excited about our partnership on OS101. Later today you will see the formal invite coming out for the TOPS Symposium. In that you will see some high-level goals of the symposium.

We wanted to share some additional detail on those goals and ask for you to share any feedback you may have on what would be valuable for you and your team to get out of the symposium.

We would appreciate you joining us on a call on Friday to share any thoughts you may have. (It is totally ok if you do not have any feedback!) To make it most efficient for us to collect any potential feedback, we ask that only one person from your organization join the call on Friday. We will send a calendar invite shortly for that call and we ask that you RSVP directly to that calendar invite by accepting or rejecting it.

The call is scheduled for 11:00 am - 12:00 pm Eastern on Friday, January 27th.

The TOPS symposium is meant to be a hand-on working session to support all of us in getting OS101 into the mainstream. The three-day symposium will include plenary talks, working sessions, time to network, and tours of NASA’s facilities. There may even be a launch during our time there! The activities are designed to be fun and engaging! Everything is built around making sure all voices are heard - supporting all personality types including our introverts and extroverts.

The goals of the symposium include:

- Laying the foundation for creating a unified approach to training 20,000 people in OS101

- Learning from those that have begun to teach the curriculum

- Addressing challenges that face us in achieving the 20,000

- Identifying key communities critical to the success of open science

- Brainstorming channels and messaging to reach and engage those key communities

Specific outcomes supporting the above goals include:

- Addressing the top challenges faced by those that have already been teaching OS101 - this will include learning about those challenges, working together to prioritize them, and brainstorming specific ideas how to address/overcome them

- Identifying specific communities that will be critical to meeting our goals of open science including diversity, number of people trained in OS101, or other specific open science goals - this will include brainstorming these communities, understanding why they are critical to meeting the goals of open science, and doing a soft prioritization of them

- Creating specific training goals for these communities - this will include listing XXXXX

- Determining ways to reach these communities - this will include identifying specific channels, messaging, value proposition, and calls to action for those communities

- If there is time in the agenda - work on Science Corps aspects

As you can see, the purpose is to work together to build a foundation to reach our OS101 goals and, in doing so, provide building blocks for you and our other partners to help reach our OS101 goals.

We look forward to speaking with you on Friday if you have any additional thoughts on what would be most valuable for your organization to achieve your goals on bringing open science to the masses.

If you have any questions, please reach out to XXXX.

Thanks,

The TOPS Team
