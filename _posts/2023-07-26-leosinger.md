Dr. Leo Singer has been a research astrophysicist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center since 2015, working on the General Coordinates Network(GCN)—NASA’s next-generation time domain and multi messenger astronomy alert system. With a background in gravitational waves, his research projects concern ground-based optical telescopes and multi wavelength follow-up. He also works on real-time analysis of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) data, signal processing, Bayesian inference, and synoptic optical transient surveys. He is actively participating in the Astropy Project, a community effort to develop Python packages for astronomy. He co-authored and co-maintains LIGO’s open source public alerts pipeline and science outreach material for astronomers, the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA Public Alerts User Guide.
