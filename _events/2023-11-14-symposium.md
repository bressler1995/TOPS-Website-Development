The TOPS Symposium is a pivotal event under NASA's Transform to Open Science initiative, designed to mainstream the OS101 curriculum and advance an inclusive culture of open science!

**The goals of the symposium include:**

- Laying the foundation for creating a unified approach to training people in open science
- Learning from those that have begun to teach the curriculum
- Identifying specific challenges and opportunities for open science training
