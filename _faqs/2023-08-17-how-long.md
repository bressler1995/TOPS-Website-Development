Open Science 101 provides participants with an online, self-paced curriculum that covers the key open science principals and methods over five modules. Learners should expect to spend approximately two hours per module. Learners with previous experience in open science subject areas may "fast-track" modules by taking and passing the module assessment with a score of 70%. If a learner does not pass the fast-track assessment on their first try, they'll need to enroll in the regular course.
