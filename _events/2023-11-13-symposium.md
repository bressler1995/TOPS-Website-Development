The TOPS Symposium is a pivotal event under NASA's Transform to Open Science initiative, designed to mainstream the OS101 curriculum and advance an inclusive culture of open science!

There may even be a [launch](https://www.visitspacecoast.com/launches/) during our time there!

**TOPS Symposium Goals:**

- Laying the foundation for creating a unified approach to training people in open science
