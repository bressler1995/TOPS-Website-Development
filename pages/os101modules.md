OS101 Module 1: The Ethos Of Open Science
{% endcapture %}

<!---Module 1 Description (Markdown)-->
{% capture os101modules-module1-description %}
Welcome to this introductory module on open science. Open Science is the principle and practice of making research products and processes available to all, while respecting diverse cultures, maintaining security and privacy, and fostering collaborations, reproducibility, and equity. In this module, you take a closer look at what open science is, the current landscape as well as the benefits and challenges. You then get a glimpse into the practice of open science including a case study. To start your journey with open science, you are presented with actions that you can take starting today, such as exploring communities that you can engage with.

OS101 Module 2: Open Tools And Resources
{% endcapture %}

<!---Module 2 Description (Markdown)-->
{% capture os101modules-module2-description %}
This module is designed to help you get started on your journey to practicing open science. It offers an introductory view of the concepts and resources that are fundamental to open science. The bridge between the concepts and the practice of the concepts is something called the use, make, share framework. There are many methods and models that define how to get started with open science. The use, make, share framework was constructed to help you immediately assign purpose to the concepts and tools that are covered in this module as well as in the entire Open Science 101 curriculum. All of the information that you learn here will be addressed in more detail as you participate in other modules but can also be applied immediately after completing this module.

OS101 Module 3: Open Data
{% endcapture %}

<!---Module 3 Description (Markdown)-->
{% capture os101modules-module3-description %}
This module focuses on the practice and application of open science for data. It provides a 'how to' process for finding and assessing open data for use, for making open data and for sharing open data. The step-by-step flows are easy to follow and can be used as checklists after you complete the module. Some of the key topics discussed include: data management plans, the process for assessing data for reuse, creating a plan for making data including choosing open formats and adding documentation, and the considerations for sharing data and making your data citable.

OS101 Module 4: Open Code
{% endcapture %}

<!---Module 4 Description (Markdown)-->
{% capture os101modules-module4-description %}
This module focuses on the practice and application of open code as part of the open science workflow. It provides a 'how to' process that follows the code development lifecycle and "Use, Make, Share" framework. Some of the key topics discussed include: benefits and limitations of open code, how to discover and assess code, considerations and methods for programming following open principles, and finally when and how to share your code.

OS101 Module 5: Open Results
{% endcapture %}

<!---Module 5 Description (Markdown)-->
{% capture os101modules-module5-description %}
Welcome to Open Results! This module focuses on giving you the tools you need to kick-start a scientific collaboration by creating contributor guidelines that ensure ethical contributorship. It starts out with a use case of open science in action, then a review of how to discover and assess open results. Next, the focus is on how to publish results which includes a task checklist. The module wraps up with specific guidance for writing the sharing results section of the Open Science and Data Management Plans (OSDMP). We will also reflect on how our society and technology are constantly evolving in the way we do science.
