Xarray is an open-source Python package that makes working with complex, multi-dimensional arrays elegant, intuitive, and efficient. Real-world datasets, such as those generated by NASA, are often a collection of many related variables on a common grid. These datasets are more than just arrays of values: they have labels which describe how array values map to locations in dimensions such as space and time and metadata that describes how the data was collected and processed. Xarray embraces the complexity of real-world datasets and enables users to use metadata such as dimension names and coordinate labels to easily analyze, manipulate, and visualize their datasets. Xarray makes data analysis more intuitive and enjoyable, while describing how data was collected and processed.
