NASA has undertaken several initiatives to promote and advance open science practices:

- **Open Access Data:** NASA provides open access to a vast array of scientific data and findings through platforms like the Science Discovery Engine, NASA Earthdata, Planetary Data System, and SciX (based on the Astrophysics Data System), ensuring broad accessibility for researchers and the public. 
- **Open Source Software:** NASA contributes to numerous open-source software projects, releasing tools and codes developed for space exploration, scientific research, and data analysis to the public domain.
- **Open Science Activities:** Initiatives like the Science Activation program engage the public in NASA science missions, offering citizen science projects, educational resources, and platforms for collaboration.
- **Policy Support:** NASA actively supports policies and guidelines that promote open science practices, encouraging researchers to share data, methodologies, and findings openly. Additionally, the recent addition of the Open Science and Data Management Plan requirement to the NASA ROSES funding solicitation applications encourages adoption of open science practices by researchers applying for NASA funding.
- **Training and Education:** NASA provides training and educational resources, including workshops, webinars, and courses like Open Science 101, aimed at equipping researchers with skills for practicing open science.
