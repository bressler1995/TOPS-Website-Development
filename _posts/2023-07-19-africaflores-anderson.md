Originally from Guatemala, Africa Ixmucane Flores-Anderson is a research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville who has been working with satellite data for over 15 years.

Currently, she works with SERVIR Global—a joint initiative between NASA and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)—as the Land Cover Land Use Change (LCLUC) and Ecosystems Theme Lead. She focuses on using optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite datasets for environmental monitoring, including but not limited to 1) water quality of freshwater bodies, 2) forest disturbances, and 3) LCLUC. She also serves as an Envoy of the NASA-Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) InSAR (NISAR) mission, and she led the creation of the joint SERVIR-SilvaCarbon SAR Handbook on how to use SAR for forest monitoring and ecosystem applications. She is also a Ph.D. candidate in natural resource sciences at McGill University, specializing in SAR applications to improve forest monitoring.
