The hard part in designing the modules is deciding what NOT to include. Modules have to be specific enough to be useful, but general enough to appeal to those who are new to any scientific field. They have to be short enough that people make it to the end, yet engaging and easily digestible. The Open Science 101 is just the beginning and foundation of how to do open science, please stay connected as NASA TOPS will continue to expand upon the foundational courses in the near future.
