Dr. Afshin Beheshti is a bioinformatician and principal investigator at KBR at NASA’s Ames Research Center. With a background in physics, he works on space biology projects related to microRNA (miRNA) and mitochondrial changes. However, he refuses to be a one-dimensional researcher, whichled him to work on various topics including COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2, cancer, high altitude impact on biology, and traumatic brain injury. He leads the Multi-Omics Analysis Working Group (AWG) at NASA’s Gene Lab, where everyone collaborates to develop guidelines and ways to process and analyze Big Data. Through this model, his team discovered that mitochondrial dysfunction, when the mitochondria do not work as well as they should, is a key biological issue during spaceflight. In addition, he is the president of a nonprofit called COVID-19 International Research Team (COV-IRT).
