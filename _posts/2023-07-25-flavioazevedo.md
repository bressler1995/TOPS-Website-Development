Dr. Flavio Azevedo is a political psychologist and an associate researcher at the University of Cambridge. Primarily, his research investigates the role of ideology and identity in supporting policies that perpetuate social andeconomic injustices. Having come from a low socioeconomic status in Brazil, he fell in love with the promise of academia as a great equalizer. This passion has led him to co-found and direct the Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT), an award-winning interdisciplinary community of almost 500 early-career scholars, aiming to integrate open scholarship principles into higher education and advance research transparency, reproducibility, rigor, and ethics through pedagogical reform and meta-science. In addition, he is participating in the NASA TOPSâ€™ effort to build the ScienceCore curriculum.
