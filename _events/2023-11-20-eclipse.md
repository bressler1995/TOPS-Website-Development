On April 8, 2024, a total solar eclipse will cross North America, passing over Mexico, the United States, and Canada. During this event, the Moon will move between the Sun and Earth, completely blocking the Sun. As a result, the sky will darken, creating an effect similar to dawn or dusk.  

Come join TOPS in exploring the data-driven domain of eclipses to help understand how open science principles facilitate the sharing and analysis of information among researchers, students, and enthusiasts.
