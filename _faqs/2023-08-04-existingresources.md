Content subject matter experts (SMEs) are bringing existing material with them to draw from and reuse. We are using existing examples, but there is an opportunity to connect these efforts while drawing on already existing material. Where existing material exists, with licensing that allows reuse, we are happy to include or reference with appropriate attribution.
